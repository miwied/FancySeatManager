#  FancySeatManager

Imagine a restaurant with a big round table surrounded by ***n*** seats. The **FancySeatManager** is an algorithm that determines if there are enough contiguous seats for a group of ***x*** people and always selects the most efficient seat for them so that the restaurant owner can accommodate as many guests as possible.</br>

## implementation 
I implemented this algorithm in [C#](https://github.com/miwied/FancySeatManager/blob/master/FancySeatManager%20-%20C%23/Program.cs) as a console application and aswell in [JavaScript](https://github.com/miwied/FancySeatManager/blob/master/FancySeatManager%20-%20JavaScript/FancySeatManager.js) with a neat visualization of the seats and groups.
It was a nice programming exercise and an interesting comparison of these two programming languages and the application of the different implementation options.

##  features

- setting the number of seats
- adding a group with x people
- auto generated incremental group-id
- remove a group with the corresponding group-id
